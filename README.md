# 🕹️ Pong Game (Python Turtle)

This is a fully functional Pong game built using Python’s built-in Turtle graphics module.
Two players control paddles on each side of the screen and try to bounce the ball past the opponent to score points.
The game tracks and displays the score for both players in real-time.

## 🚀 Features
- Two-player paddle controls (W/S for left, ↑/↓ for right)
- Ball movement with wall and paddle collision detection
- Dynamic score tracking with an on-screen scoreboard
- Game resets when a point is scored
- Object-oriented design using multiple Python classes
